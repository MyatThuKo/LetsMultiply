<h1> Day 35 of 100 Days of SwiftUI </h1>
<p> 
Today is a challenge day to build an “edutainment” app for kids to help them practice multiplication tables.
<br> 
I created this app by using 
<ol>
<li> Stacks </li>
<li> View Modifiers </li> 
<li> Binding </li> 
<li> Buttons </li> 
</ol>
For animal images, I use <a href="https://kenney.nl/assets/animal-pack-redux"> Kenney’s Animal Pack </a>. 
Animation will be added later in this project.
